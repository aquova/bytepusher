# Bytepusher

A barely functional [Bytepusher](https://esolangs.org/wiki/BytePusher) emulator, written in Nim. SDL2 is required, but no external Nim packages are needed.

This was a proof of concept. While emulation does render (slowly), there is no user input or sound, and you must keyboard interrupt the program for it to stop.
